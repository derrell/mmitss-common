# About
This directory contains *.[ch]* files generated by the open source ASN.1 compiler '*[asn1c](http://lionet.info/asn1c/compiler.html)*'. It includes SAE J2735 message sets defined in version *J2735_201603_ASN* and supports ASN.1 Unaligned Packed Encoding Rules (UPER).

# SAE J2735 DSRC Message Set Dictionary
The SAE J2735-201603 Standard and ASN files are available at [SAE](http://www.sae.org/standardsdev/dsrc/).

# ASN.1 Compiler
Users do not need to install the '*asn1c*' package. Message sets defined in *J2735_201603_ASN* have already been converted to *.[ch]* files and saved in the `include` and `src` subdirectories.

If interested, the '*asn1c*' package is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/vlm/asn1c). Additional information regarding '*asn1c*' is available at [asn1c - Open Source ASN.1 Compiler](http://lionet.info/asn1c/compiler.html).

# Build and Install
- This directory is included in the top level (directory `mrp`) Makefile and does not need to build manually.
- To build this directory manually, run `make clean; make all`.
- After the compilation process, a dynamic shared library (`libasn.so`) is created in the `mrp/lib` subdirectory.
- Users do not directly use the `libasn.so` library for UPER encoding and decoding of SAE J2735 messages, but rather using APIs provided in the `mrp/asn1j2735` directory.
